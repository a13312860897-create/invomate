  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 5, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Invomate (“the Service”) collects, uses, and protects your personal data. Invomate is operated by an independent developer known as Shimingzi (“the Developer”, “we”, “us”).</p>
  <p>We take privacy seriously and apply the principle of data minimization — we only collect the information strictly necessary for the platform to function.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>Invomate collects only limited data:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Account Data</td>
        <td>Email address and password (if registration is used)</td>
        <td>To identify your account</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Technical Data</td>
        <td>Browser type, IP address, logs</td>
        <td>For security and maintenance</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Payment Data</td>
        <td>Managed entirely by third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)</td>
        <td>For subscription and billing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Invoice Content</td>
        <td>Entered directly by users. Stored locally in your browser or encrypted in our server if saving is enabled. The developer does not access or review invoice data.</td>
        <td>To generate and manage invoices (user-controlled)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and improve the Service</li>
    <li>To provide customer support when requested</li>
    <li>To ensure compliance with applicable law (e.g., accounting retention obligations if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis (GDPR Article 6)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> To provide access to the Service you request</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> To maintain security and prevent abuse</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you voluntarily provide data (e.g., email contact)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>User data is stored securely on servers located within the European Union.</p>
  <p>Invoice data is either stored locally in your browser or securely in encrypted form on the server (if you choose to save it).</p>
  <p>Data is retained only as long as necessary for operation, then deleted automatically.</p>
  <p>You may request deletion at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:a13312860897@163.com">a13312860897@163.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. User Rights (Under GDPR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access to your data</li>
    <li>Right of rectification</li>
    <li>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
    <li>Right to data portability</li>
    <li>Right to restrict or object to processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may exercise these rights by contacting: <a href="mailto:a13312860897@163.com">a13312860897@163.com</a></p>

  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard technical measures (encryption, HTTPS, access control) to protect data. However, no system is 100% secure. You use the Service at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We may disclose data only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To comply with a legal obligation (e.g., court order)</li>
    <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of the Developer or users</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We never disclose or sell data for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Invomate may rely on third-party providers such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)</li>
    <li>Analytics or hosting services (e.g., Cloudflare, Vercel, OVH)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each third-party service complies with GDPR and processes data under their own privacy terms.</p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for users under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.</p>

  <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>As the Developer is based outside the EU, some data may technically be processed outside the EU. In all cases, equivalent protection measures consistent with GDPR are applied.</p>

  <h2>12. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Invomate is a self-service tool. Users are solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of any data entered or documents generated. The Developer cannot be held liable for any data errors, legal non-compliance, or financial loss arising from user input or misuse of the Service.</p>
