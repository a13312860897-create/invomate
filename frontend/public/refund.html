<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Effective date: <strong>2025-09-12</strong></p>
<p>We offer a 14-day refund policy for subscription purchases. If you are not satisfied with your purchase within 14 days, please contact <a href="mailto:support@invomate.app">support@invomate.app</a> with your order ID and we will review your request.</p>
<p>Refunds will be processed via the original payment method and may take 5–10 business days to appear on the customer's statement. For payments processed by third-party merchants (e.g. Paddle, Gumroad), refunds may be subject to the merchant's refund policies.</p>
